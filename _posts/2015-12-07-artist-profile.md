Noni, is a Wongi woman from Kalgoorlie in
Western Australia. Painting in an Aboriginal contemporary style she uses sharp
& bright colours. She is well known for her depiction of frangipanis with
dotted artwork upon them. Noni comes from a large well-known Wongi family in
the Goldfields, whose talents & artistic skills are passed down through the
family's generations.

From the moment she could pick up a pencil, she
would draw. Studying art in high school, her artistic skill developed over
time. After changing her dream to become a dancer, Noni returned home and
started painting again.
