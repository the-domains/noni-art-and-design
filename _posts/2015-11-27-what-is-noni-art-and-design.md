# What is Noni, Art & Design?

Noni, Art & Design infuses contemporary values, ideas, and objects with Indigenous Australian art and themes.

Interested parties may purchase Noni's expressive works from the galleries, have Noni create a personalised expression piece based on existing or new designs, or apply the designs to homeware and business stationary.

Contact Noni now to discuss how she can bring contemporary indigenous art to you.
