This piece portrays the constant scuttering of the honey ant. 

The busy pace that they move at is what I wanted to capture & liken to that of individual human lifestyles. 

We are always on the 'move' working, socialising & carrying out daily routines. 

The colours of the honey ants reflect the golden warm tones of the Goldfields & the background of the land stretching from Kalgoorlie down through to Esperance, the places where I come from.

This painting is about love & what it feels to have it consume every part of you.

Here you can see two dolphins' hearts, beating together as one.

I wanted to portray love in this way & particularly one in which all that matters is the two of you, in that moment.

This painting is about the Kulkurlas' (Silky Pear) found growing in the Goldfields of Western Australia. 

The greens of the edible fruit, the vines they grow on and also the vibrant red colours representing the dusty red lands of Wongi country.

The dark border represents the Wongi women who pick & bring them together, gathered and prepared for eating.

AU$150.00

Here you can see a cluster of multi-coloured Geckos, painted to represent many different people.

They all have similar patterns on different coloured skins, but inside they are made up of the same kind of thing. 

The vibrancy of colours in this painting represents the warmth of this recognition
