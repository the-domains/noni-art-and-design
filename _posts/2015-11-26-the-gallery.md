Ants On The Move

This piece portrays the constant scuttering of the honey ant. 

The busy pace that they move at is what I wanted to capture & liken to that of individual human lifestyles. 

We are always on the 'move' working, socialising & carrying out daily routines. 

The colours of the honey ants reflect the golden warm tones of the Goldfields & the background of the land stretching from Kalgoorlie down through to Esperance, the places where I come from.
